Arib Rezwan here. I am totally new into this coding/programming world.
17 yo as such I got plenty of time before I start with anything. My main
goal with coding is to use it in the finance sectore for the betterment 
and make consumer friendly and easy to understand products/services which is 
accessible to all. I do not have a solid plan but a gigantic goal that I want
to acheive. Team Work Only.
